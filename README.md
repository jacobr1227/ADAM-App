# ADAM - A Database for All Metroid
This is a very straightforward tool, intended to bring all sorts of accessible resources for the metroid series all in one convenient place!
This app includes things such as maps, checklists, and item locations (mostly...)

Excluded games: AM2R, Prime Hunters, spinoffs. (mostly due to lack of necessity)

Features include: a main navigation menu leading to a page for each game, maps that area zoomable and pannable, item lists with saveable checklists, a sharing feature to share progress, and a reset button. And it looks nice to boot! I even included a unique app icon that I created myself, as well as changing the app and package names to be custom.
